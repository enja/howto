# 8 - Backbone.History

The `Backbone.Router` is responsible for managing routes. The `Backbone.history` is part of routing and responsible for listening and responding to URL changes, including updates to the browsers history. The `Backbone.History()` constructor is instantiated by the Backbone library itself and an instance of `History()` is [referenced from](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-188) `Backbone.history`. The object that is placed at `Backbone.history` has one method named `start()`. Calling this method tells Backbone to begin listening for routes and to start managing the browser history. This method takes an options object with the following options and values.

```js
Backbone.history.start({

/*Boolean, default is false, true means use pushState if available and fallback to hash paths if needed.*/
pushState: true,

/*Boolean, default is true, a value of false if pushState is true means that browsers that don't support pushState will do a traditional browser reload based on URL pathname.  If pushState is false and hashChange is false then url changes will do a traditional browser reload based on URL pathname. */
hashChange: false,

/*String, default is '' and backbone assumes you are serving if from the root url (i.e. /).  A value other than '' is a string path to the directory your application is being server from and the directory Backbone should consider the root directory. */ 
root:'',

/* Boolean, default is false, a true value means don't run the default route (i.e.''). */
silent: true

});
```

You'll likely never create a `History()` instance in your code, but keep in mind that you'll almost always need to invoke `Backbone.history.start()` in order to begin monitoring hashchange events and invoke route callbacks.

### Notes:

- Due to a reliance on iframes to make hash paths work in IE its best if `start()` is invoked after the DOM is ready.
- When calling `start()` the first time, it will run the initial route. The initial route is the current url when `.start()` is called, which in turn invokes the route that is associated with any empty string property name.
- You don't have to have all of your routes defined before you call `start()`. If you don't use an initial route you can define all routes after `start()` with the `route()` method available on `Backbone.Router()` instances.
- It's not exactly intuitive, but routing is not stazrted from a `Backbone.router()` instance its started from the `Backbone.history()` instance. Just remember that router objects define routes and provides a `navigate()` method but in order for routing to start for each web page loaded into a browser, you have to invoke `Backbone.history.start()`.
