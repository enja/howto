# 1 - Article Overview

In Part 1 of [Backbone.js Deconstructed](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1367/part-1-backbonejs-deconstructed) an in-depth review of the periphery Backbone parts was completed. If you haven't read part 1, I'd suggest you start with part 1 before proceeding with part 2. At the very least I would make sure you are comfortable with the concepts discussed in [part 1, section 6, Constructing Backbone Objects](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1367/part-1-backbonejs-deconstructed#constructing_backbone_objects).

In part 2 of Backbone.js Deconstructed, we will be examining the meat of Backbone. The meat being Backbone, views, models, and collections. Equipped with the knowledge conveyed in part 1, you should be adequately prepared to get intimate with `Backbone.View`, `Backbone.Model` and `Backbone.Collection` constructors and corresponding object instances. Before we begin, I am going to lay out my strategy for discussing the meat.

While it is common that most efforts to teach Backbone start with learning about models, I actually think this prohibits learning. I believe once the peripheral parts are understood, the easiest path for grokking Backbone starts with the view. I strongly suggest a mastery of views before you attempt to populate a view with data (i.e. models or collections of models) and eventing the view to stay in sync with the data. The plan is to first examine views, then models, then collections in that order. Once each of these parts are understood, we will take this knowledge and use it to examine a [small and contrived contact's application](http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/Qwb9r/). Don't be afraid to examine [the application](http://jsfiddle.net/Qwb9r/) first, In fact I recommend it, as it will give a helpful context before reading sections 2, 3, and 4.

> I have decided to write a Part 3 in this article series focusing on the syncing of model and collection data using a restful JSON api (i.e. fetch, save, destroy, sync). I did this to keep the complexity surrounding syncing (i.e. servers and api's) out of this article with the hope that this will shine a spotlight on the nature and function of views, models, and collections.

Let's get to it!
