# 9 - Backbone Utilities

## 9.1 - Restore and Create A Unique (i.e. custom namespace) Reference to Backbone with `Backbone.noConflict()`

When Backbone is being parsed by the browser, one of the first things Backbone will do is store a reference to the value contained at `Backbone` in the Global scope (i.e. typically at `window.Backbone`). This is because Backbone will overwrite or take over this namespace and wants to give the developer the option to restore the previous value used before the Backbone library is parsed. This is where the `Backbone.noConflict()` function comes into play. Calling it will return the `Backbone` namespace to the previous owner and then return a reference to the last parsed version of Backbone.js so you can create a new namespace for it. In the code below I create a fictitious Backbone version before Backbone.js is loaded

```html
<script>

    this.Backbone = {
    "I'm the previous owner of Backbone in the global scope": true
    };

</script>
```

and use `Backbone.noConflict()` to make sure this version remains reference from Backbone while giving the last parsed version of Backbone a new namespace.

### Notes:

If you call `Backbone.noConflict()` and don't store the reference value returned from the function call you've lost a reference to the last Backbone.js code that was parsed by the browser.

## 9.2 - Assign the DOM & XHR library used by Backbone with `Backbone.$`

[Backbone will internally and automatically use any version of jQuery, Zepto, or ender (in that order) found in the global scope for DOM manipulation and XHR (aka AJAX)](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-9) by storing a reference to one of these libraries at `Backbone.$`.

If none of these libraries are found in the global scope, Backbone will attempt to use whatever value is found in the global scope for `$`, which could be `undefined` if you don't include one of the previously mentioned libraries or define your own library which uses `$` as a namespace or alias.

One can also manually provide a value for `Backbone.$` after Backbone has been parsed. In the code example below I demonstrate how `Backbone.$` can be set by either method.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<!-- functional programming utility library -->
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/1.3.1/lodash.underscore.js"></script>
<!-- needed for older browsers without window.JSON -->
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/json2/20121008/json2.js"></script>
<!-- DOM & XHR utility -->
<script>
//Backbone will use this if jQuery, Zepto, and ender don't claim $
var $ = {version:'0.0.1',name:'MyReCreateTheWheelDOM&AJAXLib'}
</script>
<!-- Backbone.js -->
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js"></script>
<!-- DOM & XHR utility -->
<script>
//Or just Manually set it after Backbone is loaded
Backbone.$ = {version:'0.0.1',name:'MyReCreateTheWheelDOM&AJAXLib'}
</script>
</body>
</html>
