# 4 - Backbone.Collection

## 4.1 - Conceptual Overview Of A `Backbone.Collection`

A Backbone collection represents a logical grouping of models and provides methods and properties for working with (grouping, sorting, filtering) these groups of models. To finalize the contact illustration I have been using in this article (i.e. a model = row of labeled data for a contact in a table), you can think of a collection as the entire table that contains rows of contact data. Below I have updated the table containing contact details discussed at the start of the model section so that the entire table can be considered a contacts table.

| Contacts: |||
|-------------|
| first name | last name | phone |
| John | Doe | 111-111-1111 |

Of course, a `Backbone.Collection` is much more than a label like the previous table might express. Collections can capture events (change, destroy, request, sync, error, invalid) that are triggered on its models and collections also have their own set of useful events (e.g. add, remove, reset, sort, request, sync).

### Notes:

- In its simplest form, a collection is simply an array of references to model instances. In fact, each collection instance provides a `models` property which is a direct reference to the internal array that contains the model instances.

## 4.2 - Creating a `Backbone.Collection` From Model Instances

To create a generic collection we only need instantiate an instance from `Backbone.Collection` and pass in during instantiation an array of model instances. In the code example I take the contact models we have been working with in this article and pass them as the first option when creating a collection.

### Notes:

- The first parameter passed when instantiating a collection can be a model instance or an array of model instances. However, if the collection being created has a reference (via model property) to a model constructor, the collection can internally instantiate models by passing a raw attribute/data object or an array of raw attributes/data objects.
- The second parameter passed to a collection constructor is an options object configuring the `url`, `model`, and `comparator` options.
- Just like `Backbone.View` and `Backbone.Model` a `Backbone.Collection` can be extended (i.e. subclassed) using `extend()` and defining an `initialize` function when extending will be invoked when a collection is created.
- A `clone()` method is provided for creating collection objects by cloning a collection instance. When `clone()` is used a new collection instance is returned containing the same models.
- A `length` property, available on collection instances, maintains the number of models it contains.
- When a model is added to a collection, the model's `collection` property is automatically update to contain a reference to the collection.

## 4.3 - Creating a `Backbone.Collection` From A Model Constructor

A common pattern for creating collections is to point the collection `model` property at a model constructor and then instead of passing an array of references to model instances, the collection itself can instantiate models from raw data and store these instances in the collection. In the code below an array of raw data and a model constructor (i.e. `ContactModel`) is passed to the `Backbone.Collection` constructor when instantiating a collection.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/JQd4T/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The results are exactly the same as passing in a reference(s) to models already created, but by using the `model` property the collections can do some of the setup for us.

### Notes:

- The `model` property can also be set when sub-classing the `Backbone.Collection` constructor (e.g. `ContactsCollection` = `Backbone.Collections.extend({model:modelConstructor}`)
- The `model` property can either point to a model constructor or be a function value that returns a model instance

## 4.4 - `Backbone.Collection` Methods, Properties, And Events

Backbone collection instances have the following [methods and properties](http://backbonejs.org/#View):

- model
- models
- toJSON
- **sync**
- Underscore Methods (28)
- add
- remove
- reset
- set
- get
- at
- push
- pop
- unshift
- shift
- slice
- length
- comparator
- sort
- pluck
- where
- findWhere
- **url**
- **parse**
- clone
- **fetch**
- **create**

The methods and properties in bold will not be discussed in this article. In the next article we will deal with the methods and properties in bold that pertain to syncing.

Additionally, collections can make use of the following built-in events:

| event type  | arguments passed to callback | description |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| `'all'`     | event name                   | this special event fires for any (i.e. not just built in events) triggered event, passing the event name as the first argument |
| `'add'`     | model, collection, options   | when a model is added to a collection |
| `'remove'`  | model, collection, options   | when a model is removed from a collection |
| `'reset'`   | collection, options          | when the collection's entire contents have been replaced. |
| `'sort'`    | collection, options          | when the collection has been re-sorted |
| `'request'` | model, xhr, options          | when a model or collection has started a request to the server. |
| `'sync'`    | model, resp, options         | when a model (or collection) has been successfully synced with the |

## Notes:

- Because collections contain models, any event that is triggered on a model will also be triggered on the collection. This means you can listen for the `model` change, `change[:attribute]`, `destroy`, `error`, and `invalid` event on a collection (e.g. `contacts.on('change',function(model,options){}`).

## 4.5 - Getting All Model Data/Attributes Out Of A Collection Using `toJSON()`

The collection `toJSON()` method will return an array containing a copy of the internal attributes for each model in a collection. In the code below I log an array that contains all of the attributes for each model in the collection using `toJSON()`.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/5v8fc/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

## 4.6 - Getting Models From A Collection Using `models`, `get()`, `at()`, `where()`, and `findWhere()`

Direct access to the array that contains all the model references for a collection is provided by the `models` property. We have used this property already in this section, but to demonstrate its value, examine the code example below which extracts the array of model instances (i.e. model objects) from a collection using the `models` property.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/wJdSz/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The `where()` method is provided so that the `models` array can be filtered by attributes. In the code example below I use `where()` to get an array of only the models in the collection that have an attribute of `{firstName:'Doe'}`;

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/wxkaD/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Using the `get()`, `at()`, and `findWhere()` collection methods we can get a single model reference instead of an array of model references. These three methods are demonstrated in the code below.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/hNVMD/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- Manipulating a collections module by making direct changes to the `models` array should be avoided given that doing so will not trigger events such as `add` or `remove`. Its better to use
- The `findWhere()` will return the first match found in the collection.
- `at()` will honor sorting order done on collections or return the model based on insertion order
- Collection's have a `slice()` method that [is a shortcut](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-98) for simply doing `models.slice(begin,end)`.

## 4.7 - Sorting A Collection

By default a collection does not sort itself. Models are simply in the order that you add them. To have a collection keep a sort order the `comparator` property should be defined as a [sortBy](http://underscorejs.org/#sortBy) function taking a single argument, as a [sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) function taking two arguments, or as a string indicating the attribute to sort by. In the code example below we pass the comparator value during collection creation so that the collection will keep models sorted by `firstName`.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kCWnt/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- Changes to a collection (i.e. `add()`) will automatically invoke the sorting logic defined by `comparator`. However, if the `attributes` in a model change, you will have to manually sort the collection using the `sort()` method to keep the collection updated and correctly sorted.
- Calling `sort()` triggers a `sort` event on collections.
- The comparator value can be set after the creation of a collection by defining a sort value (i.e. sort, or sortBy function, or attribute to sort by) for the collection's `comparator` value.

## 4.8 - Getting an Array of Model Attributes And Values From Each Model in a Collection Using `Pluck()`

The `pluck()` method is extremely handy for creating an array of all of the values for a specific attribute in a collection of models. For example, in the code below I set up a collection with three models, that all contain a `firstName` attribute. To extract the `firstName` value for each model I call the `pluck('firstName')` method on the collection.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Q9Nk5/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

## 4.9 - Adding Models To A Collection Using `add()`, `push()`, `unshift()`

The `add()` method for adding models to a collection can add a single instance of a model or an array of model instances. If the collection has a value for its `model` property, you can pass raw data/attribute objects or an array of raw data attribute objects. In the code example below I demonstrate all of these methods for adding a model to a collection.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/9K4SF/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The `push()` and `unshift()` methods function identically to the `add()` method, and taking the same parameters, except that these methods will either add the model(s) to the end (i.e. `push()`) of the collection or to the beginning (i.e. `unshift()`) of the collection.

### Notes:

- Passing the `{at: index}` option to `add()` as the second parameter will splice the added model(s) into the collection at a specific index.
- Adding a model to a collection twice (i.e. same model) will basically do nothing. The model is ignored, unless you pass the `{merge:true}` option as the second parameter to the `add()` method. If a merge occurs the `change` event will be triggered on the model and collection.
- The `add` event is triggered on a collection when a model is added, pushed, or shifted to the collection.

## 4.10 - Removing Models From A Collection Using `remove()`, `pop()`, `shift()`

The remove() method can be used to remove a model(s) from a collection by passing references to the models that need to be removed. Below I demonstrate the removal of a single model as well as a group of models from a collection.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/HEpUA/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The `pop()` and `shift()` are shortcut methods for removing models. Calling `pop()` will remove the last model and `shift()` will remove the first model.

### Notes:

- Calling `remove()` with no parameters will not remove all models. To remove all models from a collection call the `reset()`, passing it no arguments. (HUH?)
- A `remove` event is triggered on the collection when the `remove()`, `pop()`, or `shift()` methods are invoked.

## 4.11 - Add, Merge, and Remove Models At The Same Time Using `set()`

The `set()` method will update the state of the models in a collection by attempting to match the changes indicated by the array of model instances passed to the `set()` method. In other words, using `set()` will attempt to synchronize the array of models passed in with the internal state of the models in the collection by intelligently deciphering the differences and adding, removing, and merging according to the differences.

In the code example below I set up a collection and then using `set()` I add to the collection, remove a model from the collection, and update a model in the collection all using `set()`.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/FMEuj/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- The `add`, `remove`, and `change` events are all triggered when using `set()` on the model and the collection objects.
- To disable the add, remove, or merge functionality of `set()` you can pass it the options `{add: false}`, `{remove: false}`, or `{merge: false}`.

## 4.12 - Replacing All Models In (i.e. bulk replace/reset) A Collection Using `reset()`

The `reset()` method can be used to replace the models in a collection with a new set of model(s). It is essentially like removing all model(s) in a collection and adding a new model(s).

### Notes:

- Calling `reset()` with no arguments will remove all of the models from the collection.
- When the `reset()` method is used a `reset` event is triggered.

## 4.13 - Using underscore.js (or lodash.js) Methods On Models (i.e. `models`) In A Collection

A collection instance has access to many useful methods for operating on the array of models the collection instance contains. But you should be aware that [Backbone mixes into to the prototype chain of a collection](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-116) the following underscore.js (or lodash.js) methods which can be useful as well. (e.g. `myCollectionInstance.first()` same as `myCollectionInstance.at(0)`).

- forEach or each
- map or collect
- reduce or foldl or inject)
- reduceRight or foldr
- find or detect
- filter or select
- reject
- every or all
- some or any
- contains or include
- invoke
- max
- min
- sortBy
- groupBy
- sortedIndex
- shuffle
- toArray
- size
- first or head or take
- initial
- rest or tail
- last
- without
- indexOf
- lastIndexOf
- isEmpty
- chain

In the code example below I make use of the `each()` and `first()`.
