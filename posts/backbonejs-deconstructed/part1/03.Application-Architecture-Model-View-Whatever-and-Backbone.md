# 3 - Application Architecture, Model View Whatever, and Backbone

## 3.1 - Architectural Assumptions Made by Backbone

Backbone was written for use in the context of developing a SPA (AKA Single Page Application). You might wonder what that is, exactly. In short, a SPA is a web architecture which loads a single web page (typically one index.html or app.html) through which the entire application can be delivered to the client by using custom events, custom url handling, and asynchronous HTTP retrieval and storing of resources, all while avoiding traditional browser page reloads. Basically, a SPA architecture loads one HTML page so that JavaScript can then be used to mimic/override/orchestrate the default nature of the browser that is used in traditional web application architectures. Let's examine the architectural assumptions of a Backbone SPA in more detail:

- Backbone SPAs assume application logic (collections, models, views) will reside in the client (i.e. browser memory) instead of the server. Because of this, Backbone applications are typically written entirely in JavaScript. Nowadays, even some of the backend parts might be written in JavaScript (e.g. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) provides RESTful API).
- Backbone SPAs assume you want to organize the application in a loose Model-View-Whatever pattern.
- Backbone SPAs assume that after the initial synchronous loading of the single web page, any additional changes within the application will be handled asynchronously and based on custom events and custom URLs (i.e. routing URLs defined not by file system hierarchy, but by application architecture, logic, and data API).
- Backbone SPAs typically manage the changes in the URLs and browser history with their own routing and history mechanism, therein bypassing the traditional loading and caching of web pages.
- Backbone SPAs assume data manipulation and persistence (i.e. CRUD or "create", "read", "update", or "delete") using a RESTful JSON API.

Single page applications which leverage RESTful JSON APIs are the sweet spot for Backbone. If you are building something else, or the data API is not set up for REST, you might still find value in the event, model, view, and collection logic provided by Backbone, but you should be aware that you are out of the Backbone sweet spot, given that many Backbone features assume a RESTful JSON API.

## 3.2 - Backbone Doesn’t (and You Shouldn’t) Focus on the Whatever part of Model-View-Whatever (i.e. MV*)

The study of MV-Whatever patterns is not without merit. However, the study of Backbone in the context of the MV-Whatever family might do more harm than good. Backbone is an incredibly small library, and the approach one could take to grok a Model-View-Whatever architecture can be accomplished by setting aside this topic altogether and simply studying what Backbone is doing at the code level. Instead of trying to wrap your head around the very opinionated concepts surrounding the 'Whatever' part of MV-Whatever (i.e. MV*), I recommend instead that you ground your understanding of Backbone in its function and the simple notion that its purpose is to provide aid when organizing application data (models) and UI (views) for SPAs. I believe that if you learn exactly what the JavaScript is doing, you will naturally start to grok the world of Backbone MV-Whatever.

## 3.3 - Backbone is a Library, Not a Framework

Backbone is a JavaScript library which provides an event system and a set of constructor functions for creating objects that can be used in a MV-Whatever manner to organize and sync data for a single page web application. The strongest framework-like-opinions built into Backbone are found in its assumption that a SPA architecture and RESTful JSON API are in use. Remember, a framework calls your code, while a library is code that you call. Backbone, in a nut shell, is a library of constructor functions that you leverage as a developer in order to add structure to your application. It is not a framework!

## 3.4 - Backbone Doesn't Provide Everything Needed to Develop a Single Page, Thick Client, Web Application

As previously mentioned, Backbone is not a framework. It is only a piece of the application puzzle. When building out a single page web application, you will likely require many of the developer tools listed below (the list does not include solutions for building a RESTful JSON API service):

- A build tool / taskrunner (e.g. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/))
- A package manager (e.g. [Bower](http://bower.io/))
- A dependency manager (e.g. [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/))
- A UI widget library (e.g. [KendoUI](http://www.kendoui.com/))
- A testing framework/runner (e.g. [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha))
- A templating solution (e.g. [Handlerbars](http://handlebarsjs.com/))
- A scaffolding solution (e.g. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/))
- A development server (e.g. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/))

If the list above looks like a foreign language to you, then the last thing I would recommend is learning Backbone via a third party Backbone framework that leverages these tools.

Before you use a Backbone framework, research each of the above tools. Use them and make sure you understand the problem they are solving. When this is done, check out some of the non-framework [community extensions](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Extensions,-Plugins,-Resources). Doing this will help you familiarize yourself with some of the gaps other developers have found when using Backbone.

When a proper understanding of Backbone itself has been achieved (along with its gaps), and you understand the problem each of the previously mentioned tools solves, you might find one of the following Backbone toolkits/frameworks useful:

- [Vertebrae](https://github.com/tbranyen/vertebrae)
- [Thorax](http://thoraxjs.org/)
- [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org/)
- [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)
- [BBB (Backbone Boilerplate)](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb)
- [Backbone.Giraffe](http://barc.github.io/backbone.giraffe/)

However, inviting the additional layers of abstraction provided by these toolkits should be done with extreme caution. These solutions provide a great deal of boilerplate, opinions, and plenty of rope to hang yourself. I would only reach for one of these once you have a thorough understanding of Backbone and the underlining tools that these frameworks may use.
