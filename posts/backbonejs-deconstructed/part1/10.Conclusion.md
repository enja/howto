# 10 - Conclusion

[I've read and watched a great deal of tutorials on Backbone.js](http://readlists.com/f1c7b9ca/) and none of them provided a comprehensive foundation (all the parts around the meat) for grokking the function of a `Backbone.Model`,`Backbone.Collection`, and `Backbone.View`. It was my intention to alleviate this gap of information with the contents of this article.

With a thorough Backbone backdrop set into place by this article we will move on to the main stage actors, `Backbone.Model`,`Backbone.Collection`, `Backbone.View` and `Backbone.sync` in the second part of this article.
