# 5 - Backbone.Events

## 5.1 - Backbone.Events Overview

The `Backbone.Events` object contains methods that facilitate the [observer design pattern and a variation of the observer pattern called pub/sub](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh201955.aspx). These functions permit the various objects created by Backbone (really any JavaScript object) to communicate with each other in a decoupled manner. This is done by extending the prototypes (i.e. `_.extend(Model.prototype, Backbone.Events);`) of the following constructor functions with the functions contained in `Backbone.Events`:

- `Backbone.Model()`
- `Backbone.Collection()`
- `Backbone.View()`
- `Backbone.Router()`
- `Backbone.History()`

If the observer design pattern is meaningless to you and the term pub/sub is a rather mussy concept, just think of the functions contained in `Backbone.Events` similar to functionality provided by the jQuery `$('').on()`, `$('').off()`, `$('').trigger()`, and `$('').one()` methods for attaching native or custom events to DOM objects with the added ability to listen to events as well.

The `Backbone.Events` object contains the following functions which create events, trigger events, and create listening relationships between objects based on events.

- `on(event, callback, context)` or `bind()` alias works too
- `off(event, callback, context)` or `unbind()` alias works too
- `trigger(event, arguments)`
- `once(event, callback, context)`
- `listenTo(other object, event, callback)`
- `stopListening(other object, event, callback)`
- `listenToOnce(other object, event, callback)`

In addition to extending the prototype of each of the above constructor functions, the `Backbone` namespace object itself is extended (i.e. `_.extend(Backbone, Backbone.Events);`) with the properties found in `Backbone.Events` so that a global eventing system is available if needed. For example, below I created a generic `sayHi` event and an `eavesdropper` object to listen for any `sayHi` events that are triggered on the Backbone object.

### Notes:

- Keep in mind that while I just demonstrated the use of `Backbone.Events` in the context of the `Backbone` object, the original intention of `Backbone.Events` was to extend the previously mentioned Backbone constructor functions with a pattern that would allow decoupled communication.

## 5.2 - Extending Any Object With Backbone.Events

As previously mentioned, the `Backbone.Events` object properties are mixed into the prototype chain of several of the constructor functions provided by Backbone, as well as the `Backbone` namespace object. Of course, nothing is stopping you from extending any object with the functions found in the `Backbone.Events` object. `Backbone.Events` basically is a standalone set of functions that can be mixed into any old JavaScript object. Below I demonstrate this by extending the `A` object and then verifying that the `Backbone.Events` methods are now properties of `A`.

## 5.3 - Binding Events to Objects using `on()`

The `on()` method will bind a callback function to an object that will be invoked whenever the event is triggered. In the code below I bind a `whatsMyName` event to the `A` object and then trigger that event.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/eRP2w/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

A `once(event,callback,context)` method is available that works just like `on()` except the event and callback function will be removed immediately after being invoked, causing the event and callback to occur only once.

## 5.4 - Binding Multiple Events with `on()`

The `on()` accepts a string event parameter which can contain multiple events separated by a space. Below I add two events to the A object, which call the same function, and then I trigger this callback with the two different event names.

## 5.5 - Name Spacing Events with `on()`

It is possible to namespace events by using a colon in the event name followed by the namespace. Below I have added two `say` events with a unique namespace, which I then use to invoke these name spaced events.

## 5.6 - Triggering And Passing Values To A Callback Function Using trigger()

The `trigger()` method is used to invoke named (i.e. events) callback functions. Its use has been prevalent in this section. The second parameter passed to the `trigger()` method gives the option of passing values to the callback function. Below I trigger a callback function on `A` to which I pass several values.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/RnaRY/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- Multiple events can be triggered by providing a space-delimited string as the first parameter to `trigger()` listing each event you'd like to invoke (i.e. `obj.trigger('event1 event2 event3');`).
- You can trigger an event on an object that's not actually defined on that object and any object listening for this event will still be notified that the event has been triggered.

## 5.7 - Setting The `this` Context For A Callback Function Using `on()`

The third parameter that can be passed to `on()` allows the `this` context for the callback function to be set. In the code below I invoke a callback on `A` but tell the value of `this` in the callback to be `B`.

## 5.8 - Removing Events and Callback Functions with `off()`

The `off()` method can be used in the following 5 ways to remove individual events, callback functions, or all events from an object.

### 1 - Removing a named callback function:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/MAF8P/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### 2 - Removing all occurrences of an event:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/pqkJA/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### 3 - Removing all the occurrences of a named callback function from all events:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/hYrP7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### 4 - Removing all events for a specific context:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/qv5Cs/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### 5 - Removing all events and callbacks on an object:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/Ks8S4/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- Using `off()` with no parameters on a Backbone model, collection, view, or router object will remove everything including the built in BackBone events and callbacks.

## 5.9 - Have an object listen for events on another object using `listenTo()`

The `listenTo()` method gives the ability for one object to listen for an event on another object, and when that event occurs provide a callback function that is invoked. In the code example below I tell object `B` to listen for the `whosListeningToMe` event to occur on object `A`, and when it does occur invoke the `whosListeningToMe` callback function.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/AAp5c/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- A `listenToOnce(other,callback,callback)` method is available that works just like `listenTo()` except the callback function will be removed immediately after being invoked, causing the listen to occur only once.
- When an event is triggered on an object, regardless of if the event has a handler on that object, any object listening for the event is still notified that the event was triggered.

## 5.10 - Stop listening for events on another object using `stopListening()`

The `stopListening()` method can be used on objects that are listening to other objects in the following four ways:

### 1 - Stop All Listening

### 2 - Stop listening to a specific object

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/cym8q/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### 3 - Stop listening to a specific event on a specific object

## 5.11 - Backbone Built-in Events

Backbone triggers the following internal events that have been built in to models, collections, views, and the router objects. Because Backbone triggers these events we can make use of these events by way of the `on()` and `listenTo()` Backbone event methods. More on that in a minute. For now, just make sure you review the description of individual events in the table below so you start to gain an understanding of when these events are triggered.

### model, collection, view, router, and history object events

| event type | arguments passed to callback | description |
|'all' | event name | this special event fires for any (i.e. not just built in events) triggered event, passing the event name as the first argument |

### collection object events

| event type | arguments passed to callback | description |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| 'add' | model, collection, options | when a model is added to a collection |
| 'remove' | model, collection, options | when a model is removed from a collection |
| 'reset' | collection, options | when the collection's entire contents have been replaced. |
| 'sort' | collection, options | when the collection has been re-sorted |

### model object events

| event type | arguments passed to callback | description |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| 'change' | model, options | when a model's attributes have changed. |
| 'change:[attribute]' | model, value, options | when a specific attribute has been updated. |
| 'destroy' | model, collection, options | when a model is [destroyed](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-destroy). |
| 'error' | model, xhr, options | when a model's [save](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) call fails on the server. |
| 'invalid' | model, error, options | when a model's validation fails on the client. |

### model or collection object events

| event type | arguments passed to callback | description |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| 'request' | model, xhr, options | when a model or collection has started a request to the server. |
| 'sync' | model, resp, options | when a model (or collection) has been successfully synced with the |

### router object events

| event type | arguments passed to callback | description |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| 'route:[name]' | params | Fired by the router when a specific route is matched. |
| 'route' | router, route, params | Fired by history (or router) when any route has been matched. |

The above events, except for the 'all' event, will be examined in more detail in the section that deals with the object that the event is triggered on. To gain an understanding about Backbone built in events we will examine the `'all'` event now.

Built in events are triggered by Backbone objects. The `'all'` event is triggered/broadcasted anytime any event is triggered on a Backbone model, collection, view, or router.

In the code below I instantiate a Backbone model then I bind (i.e `on()`) a callback to the `'all'` event. Next, I set some data on the model. When this data is set, the model will broadcast two events, a `'change'` event as well as a `'change:attribute'` event (You can verify this in the table above). The `'all'` event gets fired twice because it's broadcasted when events, in this case two `'change'` events, are triggered.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/codylindley/svPq6/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The all event captures, as its first argument, the event that triggered the 'all' event. This allows us to log which event triggered the `'all'` event.

Don't forget, the `'all'` event is not unique to models it is triggered anytime any of the built in Backbone events are triggered. However, note that the `'change'` events are specific to models. This example should lead the way for understanding broadly how all the built in events can be tapped into when developing Backbone applications.

## 5.12 - `Backbone.Events` Conclusion

The take away from this section is that the concepts used by Backbone objects to communicate with each other are generic patterns. By understanding the generic uses provided by Backbone.Events for any JavaScript object you will be better equipped to understand how to create your own events, as well as make use of the events that are internally triggered by Backbone Models, Collections, Views, and the Router.
