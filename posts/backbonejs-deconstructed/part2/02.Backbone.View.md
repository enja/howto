# 2 - Backbone.View

## 2.1 - Conceptual Overview Of A `Backbone.View`

## 2.1 - `Backbone.View`の概念

It is common to consider a view as an isolated region of a web application.
In other words, any logical chunk of the UI, when cutting up the UI into smaller parts for development, can be considered a view.
Thus, think of a `Backbone.View` as the container (i.e. object) for the JavaScript logic that renders and updates this isolated region.
Note that a `Backbone.View` does not store data or groups of data; it is commonly the hub that references model(s) or collection(s) of data and does something with that data.

Webアプリケーションからviewを切り出して考えるのはごく一般的である。
言い換えれば、UIを小さく切り分ける際のロジック部分はviewと捉えられる。
よって、ビューの描画や更新を行うJavaScriptのロジックを考慮すると、コンテナとされる`Backbone.View`は分離されるのだ。
`Backbone.View`はデータを溜めたりするわけではなく、データを取り扱うmodel(s)やcollection(s)といったものを参照するハブのような役割であることに留意しよう。

If it helps, think of the view as the location in your code that brings together and controls the following parts:

viewは、あなたのコードにおける次のようなパートを担うものと考えると良いだろう:

- data (i.e. models or collection's of models)
- HTML template
- reference/hook into DOM element that contains the HTML markup forming the UI
- events and functions driving the UI

- データ (モデルやモデルのコレクション)
- HTMLテンプレート
- UIを形成するHTMLを含むDOM要素の参照とフック
- UIを駆動する関数やイベント

The views' job, then, is to take these parts (i.e. data, template, DOM, events) and render the UI region.

よって、viewの役割はこれらのパート（データ、テンプレート、DOM、イベント）を取り扱い、UIの表示を行うことである。

Here are some points to drill into your mind about Backbone views.

Backboneのviewについて、注意しておかなければならないポイントがいくつかある。

- Backbone views contain all of the parts necessary to construct an isolated and logical region of a web application. `Backbone.View` objects glue together data, templates, events and the rendering and re-rendering logic that occurs when data changes.
- Views do not have to be connect to a model or a collection (i.e. data). A view can simply manage an isolated and logical region of a web application.
- It is common practice for a view to reference a template (i.e. the html). This might be a stretch for some considering that views typically are the template. This is not the case with Backbone views.

- Backboneのviewは、Webアプリケーションにおいて分離されるべきロジック部分を全て内包している。`Backbone.View`オブジェクトはデータやテンプレート・イベントと、データの更新時に発生する描画・再描画ロジックを連携させる。
- viewは、modelやcollectionと必ずしも連携する必要はない。viewはWebアプリケーションにおいて分離されるべきロジックの部分をシンプルに管理するものだ。
- viewでHTML等のテンプレートを使うのは一般的な手法である。一般的にviewはテンプレートであることを考慮すれば行き過ぎているかもしれない。これはBackboneにおけるviewとは異なるケースだろう。

## 2.2 - Subclassing and Creating a `Backbone.View`

## 2.2 - `Backbone.View`のサブクラス化と作成

To create a generic view, we only need to instantiate an instance from `Backbone.View`.

```js
var myView = new Backbone.View();
```

However, it is more likely that you will be extending/subclassing the base `Backbone.View` before you instantiate an instance so that you can add your own domain specific properties.

Below I extend the `Backbone.View` constructor creating a sub-constructor (i.e. subclass) and define some contrived domain specific properties for instances to inherit.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/NTtjE/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- View instances have an internal `cid` property (e.g. `myViewInstance.cid`), which is a unique identifier automatically assigned to view when they are created. This value is [derived](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-120) from the `_.uniqueId('view')` method.

## 2.3 - Configuring A `Backbone.View` With Options

## 2.3 - オプションを使った`Backbone.View`の設定

When you are extending or instantiating a view, you can pass the following **special** properties, which are hijacked and purposed by Backbone:

```js
//Extending a view

var MyView = new Backbone.View.extend({

model: {}, 
events: {} || function(){return {}}
collection: {}, 
el: '' || function(){return ''}, 
id: '', 
className: '' || function(){return ''}, 
tagName: '' || function(){return ''}, 
attributes: {'attribute':'value','attribute':'value'}

});

//Instantiating a view

var myView = new Backbone.View({

model: {}, 
events: {} || function(){return {}}
collection: {}, 
el: '' || function(){return ''}, 
id: '', 
className: '' || function(){return ''}, 
tagName: '' || function(){return ''}, 
attributes: {'attribute':'value','attribute':'value'}

});
```

When the above special view options are passed as options during instantiation, they become properties of the view instance as well as properties of the `options` property. In the code below I demonstrate access to both.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/YWn3f/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You should be aware that non-special (i.e. foo) options only show up in the `options` property.

## 2.4 - `Backbone.View` Methods, Properties, And Events

## 2.4 - `Backbone.View`の関数・プロパティ・イベント

Backbone view instances have the following [methods and properties](http://backbonejs.org/#View):

- el
- $el
- setElement()
- attributes
- $()
- render()
- remove()
- delegateEvents()
- undelegateEvents()

We will be examining all of the above methods and properties in this section.

Additionally, views can make use of the following built-in event:

| event type | arguments passed to callback | description |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 'all'      | event name                   | this special event fires for any (i.e. not just built in events) triggered event, passing the event name as the first argument |

## 2.5 - Running `initialize()` Function When Backbone Views Are Instantiated

## 2.5 - Viewのインスタンス作成時に実行される`initialize()`関数

All view instances when instantiated will invoke an internal initialize function that can be defined when extending `Backbone.View`. Below we include an initialize function that runs when a view instance is created.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/FsPA7/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The initialize function is an ideal place to house logic that needs to run when view instances are created.

### Notes:

- The value of `this` inside of the initialize function is scoped to the `myViewInstance` that is created.
- The initialize function commonly houses events which listen for changes on models and collections.

## 2.6 - Rendering A View

## 2.6 - Viewの描画

View objects come with a default [render()](http://backbonejs.org/#View-render) method that is intended to be overwritten. The render function, by design, is intended to house the logic required to construct the view. In the code below I make use of the initialize function to call the instances render function when it is instantiated.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/RNFQK/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Not much rendering is occurring because we have yet to connect the view to an element node, but clearly the `render` function should contain the logic that constructs a view.

### Notes:

- It is not a bad idea to `return this` inside of the render function so that you can chain view methods. All of the built-in Backbone view methods follow this practice.

## 2.7 - Connecting A View To An Element Node

## 2.7 - Viewからの要素へのアクセス

Backbone views are intended to be tied to an [element node](http://domenlightenment.com/#3) which is literally either in the html producing the UI or in memory. Typically, when instantiating a view, either the `el` or `tagname` property is set connecting the view instance to an element node. Below I demonstrate both of these scenarios.

Connecting a view to an element node in the HTML page using a CSS selector:

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/hjbTR/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Connecting a view to an element node in memory:

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/UuKU4/embedded/js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You should note that connecting a view to an element node in memory will still define an `el` property value. The idea is that `el` is always a node. You can set it to reference a node in the html page using a css selector or you can create an element node in memory by using the `tagname` property. If you don't provide an `el` value or `tagname` value when extending `Backbone.View` or instantiating a view the `el` value will default to an empty `<div>` (i.e. `tagname:'div'`).

### Notes:

- The `el` property, when connecting a view to an element in the browser DOM, accepts either a css selector string (i.e. `'#myView'`) or a jQuery object itself (i.e. `jQuery('myView')`) wrapping a node element in the HTML document loaded into the browser.

## 2.8 - Setting Element Attributes On An Element Node In Memory

## 2.8 - 要素の属性値のメモリ上での設定

The view options `id`, `className`, and `attributes` provide properties which add attribute values to the element node connect to a view [when the `tagname` property is used](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-133). Below I use all three of these special properties to set attribute values on the node in memory that is connected to `myViewInstance`.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/sqAVL/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

The special properties `id`, `className`, and `attributes` do not work on nodes that are already in the HTML DOM.

## 2.9 - Using The jQuery-Wrapped `el` Shortcut (aka `this.$el`)

## 2.9 - jQueryでラップされた`el`の使用

Regardless if the element connect to a view (i.e. `el`) is in memory or in an the html page Backbone will setup a jQuery wrapper around the element so that you don't have to. It is basically a shortcut for creating your own wrapper around the element (i.e. `jQuery(this.el);`) that the view is connected too. In the code example below I verify that `this.$el` contains my `el` wrapped with jQuery methods.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/eFNPH/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

## 2.10 - Using the jQuery-Wrapped el Scoped Shortcut (aka `this.$()`)

Backbone provides [a short for performing jQuery functions scoped to the element the view is connected too](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-125). This sounds complicated but using `this.$()` is simply a shortcut for not having to write `$(this.el).find()` or `this.$el.find()` every time you want to perform jQuery tasks on element nodes contained in the view. In the code below I make use of `this.$()` selecting the `<span>` contained inside of `myViewInstance`.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/VExa9/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Notice that by using `this.$()` we are confining our jQuery selecting to the children element nodes of `el`. This is why the only `<span>` that is given the bold CSS styling is contained inside of the el (i.e. `<div id="myView"></div>`).

## 2.11 - Setting Delegated Events For A Backbone View Using The `events` Property

Backbone will wire up events for a view, which are [delegated](http://domenlightenment.com/#11.14) from the `el` node, from an `events` object that can be set when extending the `Backbone.View` or instantiating a view. In the code below I provide an events object when extending `Backbone.View` that adds a `click` and `mouseover` event to the `<button>` element in the view.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/y2EdC/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The format for defining the event and the node inside of the view (i.e. inside of `el`) the event is attached, is as follows:

```js
// event: {'event selector' : 'callback function'}

//Example based on previous JSFiddle below:

'click button': 'sayHi'

//notice the space divides the event from the selector
```

The event and the selector are the same values that jQuery normally takes as parameters when using the [jQuery().on()](http://api.jquery.com/on/) method to do event delegation.

### Notes:

- If the selector is omitted, it is assumed by Backbone that the event should be bound directly to the el node. Behind the scenes this simply means the `jQuery.on()` is not passed a selector for event delegation.
- The callback function associated with an event can either be a function value or the name of a view instance method as a string (e.g. `sayHi`).
- Events are stored on view instances in an object called `events`.

## 2.12 - Setting The Element Node Associated With A View Using `setElement()`

Using the `setElement()` method available to view instances we can change the node element that is associated with the view. In the code below `myViewInstance` is initially associated to the `<div>` in the page with an id of "myView". Using the `setElement()` method the `myViewInstance` view is set so that the node element that is associated with the view is now the `<div>` with an id value of "anotherMyView".

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/YDnAe/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

When using the `setElement()` method on a view, you should keep in mind that Backbone will remove any events on the previous element node and set them up on the new node you are moving the view too (i.e. `delegateEvents()` is called). In our code example above this would explain why the second "Say Hi!" button is functional while no longer responds to click events.

## 2.13 - Removing A View From The DOM Using `remove()`

## 2.13 - `remove()`を使ったDOMからのViewの削除

The `Backbone.View` `remove()` method invokes the jQuery [remove()](http://api.jquery.com/remove/) method on the element node that is associated with the view. The reason that you'd pick this method over simply calling the jQuery method (i.e. `this.$el.remove();`) is that it will also call the `stopListening()` event on the view instance, removing all listeners set on the view.

In the code example below I set up the rendered view to remove itself if it is clicked. Clicking on the "invoke remove()" button will cause the button itself to be removed.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/RSuX7/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- Remember the jQuery `remove()` event removes the element its call on, as well as everything inside, it.
- Backbone relies on jQuery's `remove()` method which properly removes any events before any elements are removed.

## 2.14 - Attaching Delegated Events Using `delegateEvents()`

## 2.14 - `delegateEvents()`を使ったデリゲートイベントの定義

By default, Backbone will internally call `delegetEvents()` when a view is instantiated, referencing the `events` option object for any events that need to be setup. If, for whatever reason, the events attached to a view are removed, consider the `delegateEvents()` method the tool for refreshing/reattaching the events to the view.

To demonstrate the `delegateEvents()` method, in the code below, I render a view without setting up events during extending or instantiate. After the view is created, I update the views `events` property so that the `sayHi` callback is invoked when the `<button>` is clicked. Then I use the `delegateEvents()` method to attach any events in the events object to my view.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/WF2RU/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notes:

- Calling `delegetEvents()` will remove all previous delegated event callbacks and then add them back. In a sense, a refresh.
- To remove delegated events inside of views call the `undelegateEvents()` on the view instance.

## 2.15 - Using Templates With Views

## 2.15 - View中でのテンプレートの使用

Backbone does not force you into using a specific templating engine or pattern for rendering a view. However, a templating solution for rendering complicated bits of HTML from JSON data is provided by [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/#template). I am showing a small example of how templates in underscore.js (really lodash.underscore.js) can be used.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/6K7dm/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Don't take the lack of in depth coverage on the topic of templates here to indicate the commonality of templates. Templates, in fact, are common if not almost always used when building Backbone applications. Really any web application! When rendering a view a templating engine should always be considered so that views do not become stuffed with DOM manipulation logic.
